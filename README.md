[**ProjectEuler**](https://projecteuler.net) is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. It includes over 500 problems (January 2018).

[**HackerRank**](https://hackerrank.com) is a company that focuses on competitive programming challenges. Here is the [ProjectEuler+ challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges).

Programming enthusiasts from HackerRank have modified the original ProjectEuler challenges and turned them into harder versions by increasing input size, adding hidden test cases, and setting time limit for the programs. They have redesigned the first 200 challenges so far (January 2018).

A good example might be Problem 19: Counting Sundays

Original ProjectEuler problem statement: 
> How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?

Modified HackerRank's ProjectEuler+ problem statement: 
> How many Sundays fell on the first of the month between two dates? You get the two dates (they are in format D/M/Y) as your program's input. The year can be any number between 1900 and 10^16 = 10000000000000000.
